# Computer-Networks-Laboratory
This repository contains my completed labs from the **Computer Communication Networks** course at **Ben-Gurion University**. Throughout these labs, I explored fundamental and advanced topics in computer networks, including socket programming, network protocols, error detection/correction, routing protocols, and more.

**All labs were programmed and implemented using Arduino boards and Cisco Routers**, providing hands-on experience with real hardware for network communication.

## Lab List

1. **Lab 1 - Sampling, Line Codes, and USART (Arduino)**  
   Implemented a Full-Duplex communication scheme using USART with clock and data channels on Arduino boards.

2. **Lab 2 - UART Communication (Arduino)**  
   Built a UART-based full-duplex communication with start/stop bits, odd parity error checking, and data transmission between Arduinos.

3. **Lab 3 - Error-Detecting and Correcting Codes (Arduino)**  
   Implemented Hamming (7,4) and CRC-4 error detection/correction on Arduino, enhancing data integrity over serial communication.

4. **Lab 4 - Ethernet and ARQ Protocols (Arduino)**  
   Simulated Ethernet frames and implemented Stop-and-Wait ARQ protocol with CRC validation between Arduinos.

5. **Lab 6 - Wireshark and Routing (Cisco Routers)**  
   Analyzed network traffic using Wireshark and configured static/dynamic routing on Cisco routers.

6. **Lab 7 - Intra AS Routing (RIP & OSPF) (Cisco Routers)**  
   Configured and analyzed RIP and OSPF routing protocols within an AS environment.

7. **Lab 8 - TCP & UDP Protocols (Cisco Routers)**  
   Explored connection-oriented (TCP) and connectionless (UDP) protocols. Simulated packet flows and compared protocol efficiencies using Arduino.

8. **Socket Programming (Linux C)**  
   Implemented client-server applications using Linux sockets in C. Included TCP/UDP examples demonstrating real-world network communication.
